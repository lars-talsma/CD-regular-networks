This data repository contains the data shown and discussed in the paper 'Continuously Distributing Entanglement in Quantum Networks with Regular Topologies'. 

All the data in this repository and the plots shown in the paper can be generated using the code from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/lars-talsma/CD-regular-networks/).

The data corresponds to the results of (sample-averaged) simulations of quantum networks with a regular topology (a chain, honeycomb lattice, square lattice and triangular lattice, both without ("infinite") and with ("finite") boundaries) operating a CD protocol, while varying various simulation parameters, and is stored as `data_<topology>_<parameter>.npy`. For further details, we refer to the paper and the GitHub repository.
